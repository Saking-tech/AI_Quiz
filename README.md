Welcome to the AI-Generated Math Quiz App repository! This ReactJS project offers a dynamic quiz platform focusing on multiplication and addition problems, ideal for students, educators, and anyone looking to sharpen their arithmetic skills.

Project Overview
The Math Quiz App is an interactive web application designed to give users a series of arithmetic quizzes generated by AI algorithms. The primary focus is on multiplication and addition, making it a perfect tool for enhancing mental math abilities. The application's intuitive design and user-friendly interface ensure that users of all ages can effectively engage with the content and test their math skills.

Features
AI-Generated Questions: This app's heart is a robust AI system that generates a vast array of addition and multiplication questions. This ensures a virtually endless supply of problems, keeping the quizzes challenging and engaging.
Human Review: To guarantee the quality and appropriateness of the content, all AI-generated questions are reviewed and fine-tuned by human experts. This hybrid approach helps in maintaining a high standard of accuracy and relevance.
Adaptive Difficulty Levels: The app adjusts the difficulty of the questions based on the userâ€™s performance, making it suitable for learners at various stages. Whether you are a beginner or looking for more challenging problems, the app scales to meet your needs.
Interactive Feedback System: Users receive immediate feedback on their answers, with detailed explanations for incorrect responses to enhance understanding and learning.
Progress Tracking: The app includes features to track progress over time, allowing users to see how their skills have developed and identify areas needing improvement.
Getting Started
To get started with the Math Quiz App, simply clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README file. The application can be run locally on any development server and is built to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

Contributions
Contributions to enhance the app, whether by adding new features, improving the UI, or expanding the question database, are always welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Dive into learning and mastering multiplication and addition with our AI-generated quizzes, designed to offer a comprehensive and enjoyable learning experience!

# Getting Started with Create React App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
All the javascript codes are first Generated with AI then Modified to give best results.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
